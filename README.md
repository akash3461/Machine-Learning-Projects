## 🌟 What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a way of teaching computers to learn from experience—just like humans do.  
Instead of writing long rules for every situation, we give the computer examples, and it figures out patterns on its own.

For example, if you show a machine learning model thousands of pictures of cats and dogs, it will learn to tell the difference by noticing patterns—shapes, colors, and textures—without anyone explicitly programming those rules. Once trained, it can make predictions on new, unseen data.

Machine Learning is part of our daily lives, such as:

- Recommending videos on YouTube  
- Predicting prices of houses or products  
- Filtering spam emails  
- Recognizing faces in photos  
- Helping medical systems detect diseases  

In simple terms, machine learning helps computers become smarter by learning from data and making decisions more accurately than traditional programming.
